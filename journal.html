<h1>My Journal Entries!!</h1>

<h2>journal entry #1</h2>

<p>So far in comp sci, I have learned how to link my website to the actual internet through pushing through the terminal. I have also learned how to code my people card and how you can write something in html and see it on the internet without it having to be an actual website. I really am loving comp sci this year so far! it is such a great feeling when the code <strong>actually</strong> works <em>and</em> even better when I have caught a problem and then learned how to fix it myself without Molly! <3 </p>

<h2>journal entry #2</h2>

<p>Last class we started programming the design of our websites. I learned how to paste codes of a color, add different fonts by coding the links, and create buttons on a menu bar. It was really cool to reload my index and actually have things click. Im excited to add more and just watch things come along a little better. Im still having a bit of trouble catching mistakes in code without Molly but its super fun in class when the codes are working.
