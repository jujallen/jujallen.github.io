<h1>My Journal Entries!!</h1>

<h2>setting up my website</h2>

<p>So far in comp sci, I have learned how to link my website to the actual internet through pushing through the terminal. I have also learned how to code my people card and how you can write something in html and see it on the internet without it having to be an actual website. I really am loving comp sci this year so far! it is such a great feeling when the code <strong>actually</strong> works <em>and</em> even better when I have caught a problem and then learned how to fix it myself without Molly! <3 </p>

<h2>designing my website</h2>

<p>Last class we started programming the design of our websites. I learned how to paste codes of a color, add different fonts by coding the links, and create buttons on a menu bar. It was really cool to reload my index and actually have things click. Im excited to add more and just watch things come along a little better. Im still having a bit of trouble catching mistakes in code without Molly but its super fun in class when the codes are working.
</p>

<h2>first animation!</h2>

<p>Making my first animation was a pretty frusturating process. In the end I was able to create a functioning aninimations with colors I liked but it was quite basic. At first, I had hoped to create an animation where a different carebear would appear on different parts of the screen and move around. When i tried to copy the image links though it would not show up so instead I just created different colored squares. Im still happy though because i was able to link the project to my website effectively.</p>

<h2>javascript intro</h2>
	
<p>Yesterday we made a function in javascript that was a mousefollower and used the console to log the activity of the mouse. I made a taylor swift mouse and made it follow the mouse. Its linked on my projects.</p>

<h2>first code sketch</h2>
<p>My first code sketch was actually a very good experience. Since we made the color switch function for java in class last time, making this project was pretty easy. The only thing I had trouble with was making a grid of divs and making the code for each of them.</p>

<h2>my array project</h2>
<p>for my array project, I created a bunch of divs using a function where I assigned a number to a different png in order to create an on-click code where everytime the center of the screen is clicked, the screen will flip between different Taylor Swift eras. Its super cool because you can guess which era its gonna be each time you click.</p>

<h2>square quilt</h2>
<p>For my square quilt I created a grid of many divs but rather than coding each one and creating a style for every single one, I created a function where the screen would display 0-15 divs numbered and then gave a number to each png. This was similar to array project in the sense that each png had a number. I made a grid of different disney characters. 
</p>

<h2>music player</h2>
<p>This project is probably my favorite but basically what i created was a div where when you click on it it will pause and play a taylor song and then as the viewer you guess which song is playing. It was super fun to make and the goal is if I have more time to work on it, I want to create a mix of my square quilt and this function where each photo or gif of taylor eras will play songs from the albums each time you click. I struggle i have had is figuring out how to download music
</p>

<h2>car project</h2>
<p>While I would like to advance this project a bit more so the car can move in the direction of the arrow key press, I thought it was really cool to link movement to a div since it felt like coding a game. I would love to add a race car track and make mult divs so that u can click on different cars to move around the trace.</p>

<h2>card for mom</h2>
<p>For some reason this project was actually more challenging than expected because the mouse part on its on was hard to code. the other thing i struggled with was getting the photos to shuffle through the way i wanted to. but i really liked how it turned out and my mom really like it which was sweet!</p>

<h2>circles project</h2>
<p>for this project, the assignment was to create a code that would include one aspect of the circle animation we were shown in class. For my cirlce, I did the element that allowed the color to change randomly every msecond and to move with the mouse. this project was fairly easy.</p>

<h2>slideshow</h2>
<p>this was by far my favorite project to create as I am obsessed with my dog. this was super fun to use and the templates from Hakim made this project fairly easy. I really enjoying making it. the hardest part was probably getting the photos onto the slides in the correct presentation. </p>
